[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is a very powerful note-taking app using [modified Markdown](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Basic+formatting+syntax). With a little bit of setup, it's also great for game development docs.

```ad-note
For a large team this setup does have problems as it is backed by [git](https://git-scm.com/), which won't work well when many designers are editing a document. [Obsidian Sync](https://obsidian.md/sync) exists but I've never used it & don't know how well it would scale.
```

This setup is built on a handful of foundational plugins.
## Admonitions
[javalent/admonitions](https://github.com/javalent/admonitions) is a plugin adding callouts, and making them easily customizable.  

```ad-note
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) has native callouts, but they lack a fair amount of features that [Admonitions](https://github.com/javalent/admonitions) offers.
```
