[[(game name)]] is a $\textrm{c}20$ game, similar to a $\textrm{d}20$ game, but using cards. \
The notation $\textrm{c}X$ means a deck of $X$ cards, numbered $1-X$, and shuffled.  Most actions and situations are resolved with a random card drawn from one of the decks, and the number being used to determine the outcome. After a number is drawn, it is discarded. When $\frac{1}{2}$ the cards have been drawn, the deck is shuffled once more. \
For instance, say the $\textrm{c}6$ was shuffled in this order, top to bottom: $4, 5, 3, 1, 2, 6$. The first time a $\textrm{c}6$ was used, they would draw $4$. Then $5$, then $3$, then the deck would be shuffled as that's half the deck.

haha no design doc for you you gotta figure it out urself

This a strange choice, but it's an idea I really like. And also, I'm willing try to some risky and strange things here because I wana stand out, not make money or be successfull. So why?
- Once again, strategy and timing are some of my favorite things.

The player knows what they can possibly draw. What cards have already been drawn is openly visible to everyone, and the player can set up situations where they know they can only draw a good card. E.g. you could need to draw $10 \ge$ to succeed a check, and you can look and see that $1-8$ are all already drawn so you most likely will succeed. \
My good 'ol risk/reward design comes in because everybody is drawing from the same decks. You and the enemy all share these decks and so they can benefit too, but you can also see that there are only bad cards left to draw and they can't draw a card that will succeed.

```ad-note
title: Tabletop w/o Custom Cards

A regular deck of cards can be used for this. Pick out the $1-10$ (Ace but no faces) cards of every suit.
$$\textrm{‚ô£} > \textrm{‚ô†} > \textrm{‚ô¢} > \textrm{‚ô°}$$
So for instance the $10$ of ‚ô£Ô∏è is greater than the $10$ of ‚ô†Ô∏è.
- ***Make Sure*** that if multiple suits are needed only 2 different suits are used to avoid confusion.

# State
Each deck has independent state. This means that each of the $7$ types of cards (see below) and the state on which of them have been drawn is individual to each type of card. 

| Notation       | Amount                                                          |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $\textrm{c}1$  | $0$ or $1$, true or false, binary[^1]                           |
| $\textrm{c}2$  | $1$ or $2$                                                      |
| $\textrm{c}4$  | $1-4$                                                           |
| $\textrm{c}6$  | $1-6$                                                           |
| $\textrm{c}8$  | $1-8$                                                           |
| $\textrm{c}10$ | $1-10$                                                          |
| $\textrm{c}20$ | $1-20$, standard for [[Ability Scores & Skills#Checks\|Checks]] |

[^1]: $\textrm{c}1$ means that if the card is $0$, then nothing happens, if it is $1$, something happens. It's a logic gate, not a random number.
