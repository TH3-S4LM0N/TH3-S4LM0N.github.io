Primer to Reading a Sourcebookplease please feel free to ask me questions because you are diving into the ~ point of a currently 2 year project; it will be a mess. this glossary will try to define important terms without making you read a full chapter about that thing, but if you are at all interested in reading the full chapter for that topic shoot me a message on teams or 4696493152, i'll gladly take all the eyes i can get\nA TTRPG sourcebook is not read like a normal story. It is in the 2nd omniscent person. It is written to the GM (Game master/manager), who is the one running the game for the players, who create characters to play through the story (campaign).\nIt's function over form. While I try to keep the writing itself interesting, getting the content across clearly is more important than the GM having fun reading the book.\nWhile you will see just one chapter of the book, there is a whole lot more than just X chapters. This glossary will try to summarize important relevant terms but a good ~100 pages of setting and gameplay comes before this.\nIt is non-linear. A 'chapter' more or less consists of a location and everything that could happen there depending on what the players do. Some things may never come up and some will turn out completely different depending on who plays.\nWhile the majority is story, there is chunks relating to gameplay (which will be fairly obvious). I will try to mark gameplay stuff that is unimportant from a strictly narrative perspective.\nCharacter descriptions come in an Appendix (I will attach relevant character descriptions at the end) Notes about my writing specifically: I use light language. <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://TH3-S4LM0N.github.io/Swearing.html\" target=\"_self\">https://TH3-S4LM0N.github.io/Swearing.html</a>\nI use a boatload of backlinks in my vault, none of these will work on my website but i cant be bothered to remove them manually\n<br>Incarnation: <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Myst/Myst/Part 3.

In it they will meet companions to bring, and discover a bastard curse at their very core.This tale begins with incarnation. Read the following:In the cold and damp dark of a tarnished casket, you arise. The wood is not nailed down, and slides easily, allowing you to stand straight. You are alive. You stand within a crypt, walls inlaid with many a casket same as your own. In the shadows there is complete silence. If you close your eyes you could believe you were not alive, but the cold, dead air against your skin says otherwise.<br>Penreim is split into three rooms; two crypts, and one entrance hall with a shrine to the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Chapter 3.

Next to their casket lays gifts and relics of their previous inhabitant, including various equipment pieces. This includes the starting equipment from the characters creation. <br>\nVeritas. As the Pilgrim enters the second room, they may see a figure on the other side of the room with a <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Chapter 3.

Once the Pilgrim makes themself known, <a data-href=\"Appendix J. Characters#Veritas\" href=\"myst/myst/appendix-j.-characters.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Veritas</a> will spin with dagger in hand, threatening not to get any closer, thinking the Pilgrim is a guardsmen or another grave robber like herself. She will relax upon hearing the Pilgrim is neither thing. As is customary, she will offer the Pilgrim a helping hand in getting their footing in this new life if the Pilgrim doesn't turn her over for grave robbery. Upon this agreement, she will become the first companion to join the Pilgrim's journey. <br>\nWendigo.

Unlike most diseases, caused by bad scents, imbalance of the humors, or the conjunction of the heavens, Nihirizmus was an idea, a primordial truth: Life is pointless.

Some side quests and foreshadowing are in Mebut When staying at the inn that night, you are overcome by your vampyrism and must feed, discovering your affliction. who you feed on has consequences as Veritas has Nihirizmus and will become a vampyre if you feed on her.

The gates are closed the party must pass through the Undercity to get to Capidum\n2 parts The Wilds In the wild on their way to the undercity the party encounters William and Geoffrey (rounding out a full 4 man party before reaching the undercity) The Undercity (see map at the bottom) The Undercity is a slum inside a giant cave beneath Capidum, and the original home of the Drow who were banished from Douris\nIn the Undercity, the party will be introduced personally to the 3 major factions Revolutionaries: Drow who want Myst back\nLoyalist: Raxaken nobles quelling rebellion\nThe Coven: existence is known to the pc at this point, not much else. They request meeting with the pc in Capidum once the pc enters the Undercity <br>The pcs motivation changes here. Obviously registration is out of the question during an uprising, but as the pc is a vampyre, they are involved with <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Chapter 4. Vampyrs > The Coven\" data-href=\"Chapter 4. Vampyrs#The Coven\" href=\"myst/myst/chapter-4.-vampyrs.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Coven</a> activities by association whether they like it or not\nGetting into Capidum requires help from one of the 3 factions Haven't really dug that deep yet, idk what those 3 paths are\nSomewhere in here you also meet more companions Chapter ends upon entering Capidum Peccai Orfale (Original Sin) This chapter revolves around resolving the revolution.\nThe characters may (and are encouraged too) meet with the Coven in Capidum. Here they will learn the Coven is back stronger and once again wishes to take Myst for their own. They want to recruit the pc bc they are the Arch-Vampyre, but they do not tell the pc this yet\n3 paths to resolving the revolution: Loyalists pc helps assassinate the revolutionary leader\nCoven is pulling the loyalists strings and the Coven takes over Myst Revolutionaries pc helps assassinate the Raxaken governor\nCoven swoops in in the disarray with overwhelming force and takes control of Myst Coven pc helps assassinate the Raxaken governor explicitly for the Coven to take over Myst\nCoven takes over Myst No matter what the Coven will take Myst by storm\nDepending on which faction you side with, they will offer you a companion to assist who will stay with you afterwards By the end of this chapter you have had a chance to recruit all the companions Nihirizmus (Nihilism) &amp; Suki bum Suki (I am that I Am) Non-plot notes These 2 chapters blend together because there aren't any distinct fights yet. I'm not sure where I will draw the line.\nThis is where theology comes into play.\nThis is also where the story really starts to branch and so from here onward my descriptions will be more and more vague. I plan to makes flow charts for each chapter and the plot as a whole eventually.\n<br>At this point, your companions do not know you are a vampyre, but your companions and people you meet have made their minds very clear about vampyres with all this talk of the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Chapter 4. Vampyrs > The Coven\" data-href=\"Chapter 4. Vampyrs#The Coven\" href=\"myst/myst/chapter-4.-vampyrs.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Coven</a>. Nihilism has been drilled home. You (the vampyre, the sinner) are a worthless wretch <br>Each companions individual story also has a midpoint at which they are infected with Nihirizmus: they realize the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Chapter 3.

The Numein\" href=\"myst/myst/chapter-3.-the-numein.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Numein</a> are false, and their life is pointless. That midpoint for most of them is somewhere around here. At the start of this chapter, your Arch-Vampyrism is revealed. Depending on your previous allegiances The Coven will tell you\n<br>The Vobidashi, a <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Chapter 4. Vampyrs\" data-href=\"Chapter 4.

They will react accordingly (they will not turn to violence, as they all have Nihirizmus and are questioning their worldview)\nThrough the Vobidashi, you will also learn of Helen Cagth Suporits. She is the new Arch-Vampyre of the Coven. Helen is a theological rock in this story (not in a good way). She long ago Contracted Nihirizmus and vampyrism\n<br>Concluded the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Chapter 3. The Numein\" data-href=\"Chapter 3.

She is the pc. The problem is that by the end of the story, she will not be able to overcome her pride and bow down before a great God. <br>Unknown to most of the Coven, Helen aims to drink the blood of the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Chapter 3.

You can roll up to Libeva's temple in Lethuis and she is literally there. I do this because I think it helps personify what each of them represent very strongly.

Which order the Coven goes to them is chosen at random, but Madiven is always last. The party can also choose the order they wish to visit the Numein. Each Numein has one of 3 outcomes The Coven got there first, and it's too late\n<br>Party and <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Chapter 4. Vampyrs > The Coven\" data-href=\"Chapter 4.

The party may stay with a Numein to defend them personally, just warning a Numein does not guarantee the Coven won't get to them Yonum and Kwaarum are the Triad and Triptych respectively, each centered in one of the major citites, each city having 3 major temples, 1 for each Numein. This effectively boils down to 6 timed side quests in 2 different cities and 1 major quest on Madiven's throne island\n<br>How many <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Chapter 3.

If they fail to save any of them, it's practically impossible. If they save 7, Helen will be a pushover (statistically nigh impossible). The party is expected to save ~3 Shi no Umbruw no Moorti (The Valley of the Shadow of the Death) The Valley of the Shadow of the Death is where the thinnest point in the veil between Okultos and Ikkown rest, and where Helen will go after the Numein are dealt with. The players will be level 10 here. This chapter is for the most part a dungeon crawl to Helen's boss fight.
