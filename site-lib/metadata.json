My problem with the witcher and it's world and themes is that it doesn't represent the monsters we become. Throughout all of his philosophy about what truly makes a monster, Geralt has a holier-than-thou attitude because he's a witcher.

While a nearby village eventually dug them out, they had turned to the flesh of their target for bread, and while Geoffrey made it out, his partner was a sickly yellow by the time they were freed. Within days of eating the corpse, his partner began to turn to something of legend.

You stand within a crypt, walls inlaid with many a casket same as your own. In the shadows there is complete silence.

Most governments do not take such a stance, as even with the dangers it poses, sorcery is too great a gift too overlook. Most governments require sorcerers to be sanctioned and carry a warrant, allowing them to practice.Sorcery is a well studied phenomena, and scholars have grouped and categorized all forms of it by three different rankings of power—how difficult it is too perform and how much effect it has on the world. Cantrips are minor focus of psychic forces, that can be performed by anyone with some potential and a little training. Use of a cantrip generally does not make one a sorcerer. Aptitudes are the majority of sorcery. Aptitudes are scaled from one through five, and concern all manner of psychic phenomena and ability. <br>\nDominions are the greatest feat a sorcerer can perform.

Successful usage of a dominion often kills the sorcerer. Even if they survive, they will never practice sorcery again.\nAlong with their power, all sorcery is also grouped by its annal, or the domain it affects.

Harnessing the nature of a being of pure psychic energy made manifest, they imprint their aptitudes upon it's still living flesh, bending it to their will. Occuli require immense training to use, and a sorcerer who has mastered them is known as an Occulus.While the psychic energy of sorcery is closely tied to the sorcerer, it can be imbued into an item, losing much of it's power. These objects are known as psionics. While the energy is separated from it's sorcerer, it retains a thin link. Because of such, when a humanoid comes in direct contact with a psionic, they feel the emotions of it's creator, far in the back of their mind. This phenomena has been studied in an attempt to read minds or communicate, but nothing has come of it.Some aptitudes create illusions of varying quality and perceivability. Mastery of illusions is measured in 2 parts: minor or major, and ethereal or perfect. Minor illusions are of little stature, no larger than a 4 square feet. Most minor illusions are of inanimate objects such as secret walls or doors, but can also be of small living things. Minor illusions often do not require their exerters full concentration. <br>\nMajor illusions are any illusion larger than a minor one, and require much more sorcerous ability to maintain. They can range from a humanoid to a whole building (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Myst/Export/Preface > GM Discretion\" data-href=\"Myst/Export/Preface#GM Discretion\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">GM discretion</a>), as long as the sorcerer can concentrate on it. <br>\nEthereal illusions exist visually and auditorily.

The Triptych exists on the opposite side, where Libeva, Geluna, and Shizuur offer a self-gratifying worldview.Numein Sybollogy Madiven His symbol represents apathy, but power above\nA throne, looking down on the world The Triad Vritsu: She represents kindness and selflessness Clasped hands Dikum: Generosity A coin falling into an open hand Mortud: Professional dedication to greater good A shining city The Triptych Libeva A fist clamps a bag of money as a head rolls Geluna Dice fall on mountain peaks Shizuur The wine glass, overflowing Numein Individual Representation\nMadiven: Neutrality, apathy, just not caring about the greater meaning of existence\nThe Triad: Escaping death by doing good in life Vritsu: Kindness\nDikum: Generosity\nMortud: Care (professional) The Triptych: Pleasing oneself as much as possible before death innevitably comes Libeva: Greed\nGeluna: Adventure, discovery, luck\nShizuur: Sloth <br>Once, a regionally popular bard in <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Part 5. Douris\" data-href=\"Part 5. Douris\" href=\"myst/myst/part-5.-douris.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Douris</a> sang a ballad, claiming to be the story of how the Numein and Ikkown came to be. It was played once, met with cries of \"dunt lunus\" and \"meugloval\". And the bard was mocked out of his career. While the ballad's story was met with jeers by the commoners and priests of the Numein, the few who understood the true state of existence knew of it's truth. The following is a summary of it's contents, as the original verse has been lost to time. The ballad was entitled Madiven, the Triad, &amp; the Triptych, or the Vices of Man. \\O one we have forgot! Remind us of a tale, Preerus! Who suffered not the lies of our fallen gods.And so he stood, before Madiven, one they call Creator! Lord! And god!

When Preerus, the first man, was made, Schietor called.\"Preerus. Come and see the downfall of your creators.\"His voice booms like thunder, and Preerus can do naught, but fall prostrate in awe and wonder before glory.On his journey to the place Schietor called him, Preerus met temptation. Both good and evil.Here the meter goes to 7/4I had to change Diakumu's name to Dikum to fit the meter hereThe Triptych. Valsai Kwaarum. Libeva offers the self. Geluna, the unknown.

True creator and lord.\"Be still, and know that I am God.”But when Preerus returned, exalting his Lord's glory, he found his fellow men had been deceived.In shock and awe, they lay, prostrate fore the Numein. Near-sighted to their death, eternity forgotten.And so Preerus resigned himself to the mountains, to watch mankind decay.

Vampyrs","icon":"","description":"Nihilism, Vampires, and the Heart of MeThis is the true heart of Myst. This is the center of my theological arguments and the entire theme and point of my life. I love vampires. They've always been my favorite fantasy design because they are unlike anything else. They are 100% man and 100% monster, the same as real humans. They are a wonderful paradigm of sinful nature, and they bring the true monster within every fallen man to light. There is no redeeming them. There is no cure. You are a blasphemous scourge to be raised upon a stake and burned, with no salvation. Some vampire stories take advantage of this. But they often do not take the next step in the analogy. Stopping there leaves only nihilism. That is what a vampire is for someone with no salvation. An embodiment of the pointless life they live. Nihilism. If I was not a Christian I would be dead, but in a parallel universe where I don't kill myself, I would be a raging nihilist; and with the information that I would have, I would be right to an extent.\nentropy noun, en-tro-py 2.a: the degradation of the matter and energy in the universe to an ultimate state of inert uniformity \"Entropy&nbsp;is the general trend of the universe toward death and disorder.\" - James R. Newman 3: Chaos, Disorganization, Randomness Meriam Webster The world we live in is an illogical one. It does not make sense. It is inconsistent, chaotic, disorganized, and random. Embracing this will only lead to madness, as we see in the world right now. Leaning on logic tells us nihilism: that the story ends here, that there is no explanation for existence. It is Chaos. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhammer_40,000\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhammer_40,000\" target=\"_self\">Warhammer 40,000</a> is one of my biggest inspirations in this regard.\nIn the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war.\n40K coined the term <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimdark\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimdark\" target=\"_self\">grimdark</a>, and created a genre. An average person would tell you that grimdark settings are hopeless, existence is futile, and at best nothing at all awaits beyond the veil. All of this is true, but people often fail to make the connection. Our world without a God is a grim dark place. Grimdark settings are nihilism embodied. In 40K, Chaos is not only personified, but factionized. Chaos is a person, and that person represents the madness wrought by accepting an illogical existence. But once again, the analogy ends there. There is no God in 40K. Ikkown is a grimdark setting. Most people live to serve lesser deities who cannot prevent death, even if above it themselves. Their life is pointless. I wrote nihilism to be a disease, an affliction: Nihirizmus. I did so because the player simply understands the analogy better when nihilism isn't some mental concept, it is a real thing that affects you once you believe it. Once a person has contracted Nihirizmus, they are susceptible to becoming a vampyre, and becoming nihilism and sinful nature embodied. And that is it to start with in Ikkown. God is still in his 500 years of silence, and so life is hopeless. I want to pause and take a deeper look at the different types of nihilism. I have chose to break it into 3 for my representations here. Existential + Moral: This is conventional nihilism. Life is meaningless, morals are baseless, but they don't have the guts to kill themselves yet.\nEpistemological: These believe that thinking too deep about existence will drive you just as mad as accepting it. Both roads lead to damnation, and so let anarchy reign.\nAbsurdism: This is the belief that as the world is illogical, there must be a secret, a key to the door. This rests on the pillar belief that the world must be logical. The problem with all 3 of these as worldviews is that they are temporary. They are a worldview that has not reached its endpoint yet. For someone who is truly existentially and morally nihilistic, the end conclusion is suicide. Epistemological nihilism is just chaos; there is no thought. Absurdism is an active search for a meaning to existence, not an endpoint. So what does a vampyre really represent in Myst. They are sinful nature that is unaware it is reedemable.<br>Beasts of all kinds are common in <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Myst/Export/Part 3.

It is in the 2nd omniscent person. It is written to the GM (Game master/manager), who is the one running the game for the players, who create characters to play through the story (campaign).\nIt's function over form. While I try to keep the writing itself interesting, getting the content across clearly is more important than the GM having fun reading the book.\nWhile you will see just one chapter of the book, there is a whole lot more than just X chapters. This glossary will try to summarize important terms but a good ~100 pages of setting and gameplay comes before this.\nIt is non-linear. A 'chapter' more or less consists of a location and everything that could happen there depending on what the players do. Some things may never come up and some will turn out completely different depending on who plays.\nWhile the majority is story, there is chunks relating to gameplay (which will be fairly obvious). I will try to mark gameplay stuff that is unimportant from a strictly narrative perspective. Notes about my writing specifically: I use light language. I have a doc about this somewhere, if I don't attach it to however this gets posted ask me about it if you want. Not everything I've written is included in this rn, only whats relevant to chapter 1.
